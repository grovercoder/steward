# Steward

The intent is to create a personal digitial agent.  This agent can undertake common tasks on the behalf of the user allowing the user to focus on other things.

The capabilities of the agent are to be extended via a plugin system.

An event system will be used to utilize inter-plugin communications.  This should allow for loosely coupled plugins where a plugin does not need knowledge of how other plugins work.

The Steward system is expected to provide a daemon service.  With this in mind a socket interface will be the initial approach to providing this service.
